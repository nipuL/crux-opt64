POST-INSTALL:

to run an own bitlbee server add the following line to your inetd.conf:

6667 stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/bitlbee

Creating a special BitlBee user and running BitlBee with that UID (instead
of just 'nobody') might be a good idea.

Bitlbee stores it's config by default in the directory: /var/lib/bitlbee which
should be created and be owned by nobody (but this task will be carried out
by the post-install script, too).

there are also public bitlbee servers available at (use with caution):
http://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/servers.html

if you connect to a server the first time, simply follow the instructions of
root.
