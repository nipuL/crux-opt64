PRE-INSTALL:

This is the install process for apache, if you use a different webserver you can 
figure it out on your own...

Give apache write permissions to the config folder:

	# chown www:www /var/www/pitchfork/config

Add the following line to /etc/apache/httpd.conf:

	Include /etc/apache/extra/pitchfork.conf

Make any required changes to pitchfork.conf, then restart apache.
You can then verify it works by connecting to http://localhost/pitchfork/
